## zite login

Authenticate with your Zite account. Opens a browser window for OAuth.

```bash
zite login
```

This stores your credentials locally and connects your CLI to your Zite workspace, integrations, and permissions.

## zite dev

Start the local development server.

```bash
zite dev
```

Your app runs at `http://localhost:3000`. The dev server:

- Watches for file changes and reloads
- Auto-generates SDKs in `.zite/` when integration metadata changes
- Provides a user switcher for testing as different team members (internal apps)

## zite connect

Connect an integration to your app.

```bash
zite connect <service>
```

Opens a browser window for OAuth authentication with the service. After connecting, Zite updates your `zite.config.json` and generates the SDK.

**Examples:**

```bash
zite connect airtable
zite connect slack
zite connect openai
```

See [Integrations](/integrations) for the full list of supported services.

## zite generate

Regenerate SDK files from your current integrations.

```bash
zite generate
```

Fetches the latest metadata from your connected services and regenerates the `.zite/` directory. Use this after changing your schema in a connected service (e.g., adding a table in Airtable).

<Tip>
  `zite dev` runs generation automatically on startup. Use `zite generate` when you want to refresh SDKs without starting the dev server.
</Tip>

## zite new

Scaffold a new Zite project.

```bash
zite new <project-name>
```

Creates a new directory with the starter template. See [Installation](/cli/installation) for the full setup flow.

## zite deploy

Manually trigger a deployment.

```bash
zite deploy
```

Builds and deploys your app to Zite. This is an alternative to the automatic deployment that happens on `git push`.

See [Deployment](/deployment) for more details.
