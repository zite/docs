Zite.js publishes a `skill.md` file that describes the framework's capabilities, project structure, and conventions. AI coding tools like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) can use this file to generate more accurate code when building your app.

## What's in the skill file

The skill file gives AI agents a structured summary of:

- **Capabilities** — what Zite.js can do (integrations, endpoints, permissions, authentication)
- **Project structure** — where files live and what conventions to follow
- **Constraints** — what to avoid and what patterns to use
- **Workflows** — common tasks like connecting an integration, creating an endpoint, or deploying

This is different from reading raw documentation. A skill file tells agents _what they can accomplish_ and _what inputs they need_, rather than requiring them to search through pages of docs.

## Install the skill

Run this from your project directory:

```bash
npx skills add https://zite.com/docs
```

This downloads the skill file and makes it available to your AI coding tool.

## Add the MCP server

For deeper documentation search, add the Zite.js MCP server to your AI tool. This gives the agent access to search across all Zite.js documentation at query time.

Follow the setup instructions at [MCP server configuration](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/ai/model-context-protocol).
