Zite apps deploy automatically when you push to your connected GitHub repository. Every push creates a new deployment that you can view, inspect, and roll back to.

## Push to deploy

Commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add task filtering"
git push
```

Zite builds and deploys your app automatically. Your app is live at `https://<your-app-id>.zite.so`.

View deployment status on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://zite.com/dashboard).

## Manual deployment

You can also deploy without pushing to Git:

```bash
zite deploy
```

This builds and deploys the current state of your local project.

## View deployments

The **Deployments** page in your dashboard shows a history of every deployment with:

- Timestamp and status
- The commit that triggered the deployment
- Who made the change

## Rollback

To roll back to a previous deployment, select it in the dashboard and click **Rollback**. This redeploys the selected version without modifying your Git history.

<Tip>
  Rollbacks are instant — they redeploy an existing build rather than rebuilding from source.
</Tip>

## Custom domains

By default, your app is available at `https://<your-app-id>.zite.so`. You can add a custom domain in the **Settings** page of your dashboard.

<Steps>

<Step title="Add your domain">

Go to **Settings > Custom domains** in your dashboard and enter your domain.

</Step>

<Step title="Update your DNS">

Add a CNAME record pointing your domain to `cname.zite.so`.

</Step>

<Step title="Wait for verification">

Zite provisions an SSL certificate automatically. This usually takes a few minutes.

## Preview vs production

Every deployment has two environments:

| Environment | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Production | `https://<your-app-id>.zite.so` | The live version of your app, served to users. |
| Preview | Shown in dashboard | A preview of your latest push, accessible from the dashboard before promoting to production. |

## Audit logs

Every deployment and API request is logged. View audit logs in your dashboard to see:

- All SDK calls made by the app (which tables were read/written, by whom)
- Deployment history and who triggered each deploy
- Permission checks and denials
