Zite.js is a framework for building internal tools and business apps. It connects to your services, generates type-safe SDKs, and gives you row-level permissions out of the box.

## Why Zite.js

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Integrations" icon="plug">
    Connect Airtable, Stripe, Postgres, and other services with a single command. Zite generates type-safe SDKs from your live data — no manual API wrangling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permissions" icon="shield">
    Define row-level permissions in your code. Control which tables, fields, and records each user can access — whether your app is internal or public.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Internal apps" icon="lock">
    Build apps that are only accessible to your team. Authentication is handled automatically through your Zite workspace.

## How it works

<Steps>

<Step title="Connect your services">
  Link Airtable, Stripe, Postgres, or any supported integration. Zite generates SDKs with full type safety from your live schema.
</Step>

<Step title="Build your app">
  Write your app using the auto-generated SDKs. Define permissions directly in code to control data access.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy">
  Push to GitHub and your app is live. Zite handles hosting, authentication, and audit logging.
</Step>
