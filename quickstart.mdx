description: "Build and deploy your first Zite app in minutes"

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 20 or higher
  - Git installed
  - A [Zite account](https://zite.com/start)
</Info>

<Steps>

<Step title="Create your project">

Go to [zite.com/start](https://zite.com/start) to create a new app. Connect your GitHub account and we'll create a repository with a starter template.

Clone the repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/my-app.git
cd my-app
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install the CLI">

The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher. Use an LTS version for stability.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g zite
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g zite
```

</CodeGroup>

See [Install the CLI](/cli/installation) for full details and troubleshooting.

</Step>

<Step title="Log in">

```bash
zite login
```

This authenticates your CLI with your Zite account and connects your local environment to your project's integrations and permissions.

</Step>

<Step title="Start the dev server">

```bash
zite dev
```

Your app is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Tip>The dev server watches for file changes and auto-generates SDKs when your integrations update.</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Connect an integration">

Connect your first service. For example, to connect Airtable:

```bash
zite connect airtable
```

This authenticates with Airtable and generates a type-safe SDK in your `.zite/` directory. Use it in your app immediately:

```typescript
import { airtable } from ".zite/integrations/airtable";

const records = await airtable.tasks.list();
const task = await airtable.tasks.create({
  name: "Ship v1",
  status: "In Progress",
});
```

The SDK is auto-generated from your connected data — field names, types, and relationships are all handled for you.

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy">

Push your changes to deploy:

```bash
git push
```

Your app is live at `https://my-app.zite.com`.
