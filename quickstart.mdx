This guide walks you through creating a Zite app, deploying it, and connecting your first integration.

## Before you begin

Zite.js apps live in Git repositories. When you create a new app, Zite sets up a repository with a starter template and configures automatic deployments.

</Tip>

## Deploy your app

Go to [zite.com/start](https://zite.com/start) and complete the onboarding. You'll connect your GitHub account, and Zite will create a repository with a starter template and deploy it automatically.

## View your deployed app

Your app is now live at `https://<your-app-id>.zite.so`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://zite.com/dashboard).

<Tip>
  Your app is ready to share with your team immediately. You can add a [custom domain](/deployment) later.
</Tip>

## Make your first change

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the CLI">

The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher. Use an LTS version for stability.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g zite
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g zite
```

</CodeGroup>

See [Install the CLI](/cli/installation) for full details and troubleshooting.

</Step>

<Step title="Clone your repository">

Clone the repository that Zite created during onboarding. You can find the link in your [dashboard](https://zite.com/dashboard).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/my-app.git
cd my-app
```

</Step>

<Step title="Log in">

```bash
zite login
```

This connects your local environment to your Zite account, integrations, and permissions.

</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">

```bash
zite dev
```

View your app at `http://localhost:3000`. The dev server watches for file changes and auto-generates SDKs when your integrations update.

</Step>

<Step title="Push your changes">

Commit and push to trigger a deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My first change"
git push
```

Zite automatically deploys your changes. View your deployment status on the [Overview](https://zite.com/dashboard) page of your dashboard.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Connect an integration

Connect your first service. For example, to connect Airtable:

```bash
zite connect airtable
```

This generates a type-safe SDK in your `.zite/` directory. Use it in your [endpoints](/endpoints):

```typescript
import { Tasks } from ".zite/sdks/myAirtable";

const tasks = await Tasks.findMany();
const task = await Tasks.create({
  name: "Ship v1",
  status: "In Progress",
});
```

The SDK is auto-generated from your live data — field names, types, and relationships are handled for you.

See [Integrations](/integrations) for the full list of supported services and detailed setup guides.

## Choose your access mode

By default, new apps are **internal** — only your Zite workspace members can access them. To build a public-facing app with user sign-in, set `accessMode` to `"external"` in `zite.config.json`:

```json title="zite.config.json"
{
  "accessMode": "external"
}
```

See [Authentication](/authentication) for how to add sign-in with email, Google, or SSO to external apps.
